\section{8.1.1} \chi \geq \nu^2 / (\nu^2 - 2 \epsilon ) 
From 1.1.3 \epsilon \leq \ % \nu choose 2
Corollary 8.1.2 gives us $\chi \leq \Delta + 1
Use $\chi \geq \frac{\nu}{\alpha(G)}

Rearrange 1.1.3 so that it is in the form of alpha \geq 1

Then argue that it shows that the postulated equation holds... kinda dodgy

Intuition is that the number of colors must be greater than the number of vertices divided by the size of the maximal independent set. This makes sense as if the colors were less than there would have to be a larger color set than the independent set - obviously impossible.


\section{8.1.7}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Any graph with an empty edge set is 1-colorable. But any such graph with $\nu > 1$ has subgraphs that are also 1-colorable. So $K_1$, having an empty edge set and null subgraphs, is the only 1-critical graph. 
\item A 2-critical graph must have subgraphs that are at most 1-critical. From (a), we know that only $K_1$ is 1-critical. Therefore a 2-critical graph must be composed only of subgraphs $K_1$ \emph{and no other subgraph}. Consider a graph on 3 vertices. In order for this graph to be 2-colorable it must have one or two edges, as no edge would make it 1-colorable and three edges would make it 3-colorable. However, now the graph has a subgraph that is $K_2$ which is 2-critical and so any 3 vertex graph cannot be 2-critical. Extend this argument to any higher vertex number graph. Similarly the graph on 2 vertices but no edge is only one colorable, leaving only $K_2$ as a possible 2-critical graph.
\item Odd cycles are 3-colorable. Any subgraph of an odd cycle is a bipartite graph. Since any bipartite graph is 2-colorable, then by definition odd cycles are 3-critical.

\section{8.3.1}
Does it though? A subdivision of K_4 has as many degree 2 vertices as you like... I don't get it.

\section{8.4.1}
$G \dot e$ is an edge contraction. 
Trying to apply the recursive algorithms by hand is... time consuming. I won't do it.
Presumably you could write a program, but that's a little bit much to ask isn't it?
Do one step of second recursion, then recognise that the two resultant graphs are symmetric complete. Take the complete subgraph, raise to the power of the symmetry, divide by the intersection.

a) add edge down the middle.
b) add edge down the middle and start dismantling.
